# UFOs
  
## Overview of Project
  
The project provides a more in-depth analysis of UFO sightings by allowing users to filter for multiple criteria at the same time. In addition to the date, table filters like city, state, country, and shape were added. The code and the data for this project is stored in the 'static' folder.
  
## Results
  
A user would travel to the [index.html](https://github.com/chkCreate/UFOs/blob/a27a277d90843dba11747fc7f5768665e215a879/index.html) by clicking on the file, and then navigated to the website for an introduction on UFO sightings. In the filter searches, the user can enter five criterias such as date, city, state, country, and shape of the various UFO sightings around the world. See image below for an example filter.

## Summary
  
The new design works only for these five criteria, so it limits the user on the range of searches they can run on this website. Two recommendations for the site development would be to include the full range of filters and include an export of data function for ease of access to the user for data analysis.
